# No_God_Please_NO

A 2D arcade-style game built with Python and Pygame, featuring dynamic upgrades, block-breaking mechanics, and exciting gameplay inspired by classic arcade games. I started this as a fun side project and plan to enhance it with sounds, additional power-ups, and other exciting features as I get time.
